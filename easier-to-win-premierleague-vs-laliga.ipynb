In this article, we aim to settle the discussion using statistical analysis. By examining the average points earned by the league winners from 2009 to 2022, we'll compare the difficulty of clinching the top spot in each league. However, we won't solely rely on numbers; we'll employ a T-Test to ensure the statistical significance of our findings.\n","\n","The dataset used for this analysis is the \"Performance Data on Football Teams 09 to 22.\" This dataset encompasses a comprehensive range of performance statistics for football teams participating in the Premier League and La Liga during the period from 2009 to 2022.
